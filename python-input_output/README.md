## Context

Handling files and data streams is an essential part of programming. This project will help you explore how Python manages file input and output operations, text and binary files, and data serialization using JSON.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Open, read, write, and close files in Python.
- Work with different file modes: read (`r`), write (`w`), append (`a`).
- Use `with` statements for better file handling.
- Handle exceptions when working with files.
- Understand JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Save and load Python objects using JSON.

## Concepts Covered

- **File Handling**: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- **File Modes**: Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Append (`a`), Binary (`b`).
- **Context Managers**: Using `with open()` for efficient file handling.
- **Error Handling**: Handling `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions.
- **JSON Serialization**: Converting Python objects to JSON format.
- **JSON Deserial
