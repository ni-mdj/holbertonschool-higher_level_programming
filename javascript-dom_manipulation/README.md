# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project

This project is focused on manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. It includes various tasks that demonstrate how to interact with HTML elements, handle events, and make network requests.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-script.js`: Updates the text color of the header element to red (#FF0000) using `document.querySelector`.
- `1-script.js`: Changes the text color of the header element to red (#FF0000) when the user clicks on the element with id `red_header`.
- `2-script.js`: Adds the class `red` to the header element when the user clicks on the element with id `red_header`.
- `3-script.js`: Toggles the class of the header element between `red` and `green` when the user clicks on the element with id `toggle_header`.
- `4-script.js`: Adds a new `<li>Item</li>` element to a list when the user clicks on the element with id `add_item`.
- `5-script.js`: Updates the text of the header element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on the element with id `update_header`.
- `6-script.js`: Fetches the character name from a specified URL and displays it in the HTML element with id `character` using the Fetch API.
- `7-script.js`: Fetches and lists the titles of all Star Wars movies from a specified URL and displays them in the HTML `<ul>` element with id `list_movies`.
- `8-script.js`: Fetches a greeting in French from a specified URL and displays the value of "hello" in the HTML element with id `hello`.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project, linking to the various JavaScript files and providing the structure for the web page.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (version 57.0 or later).
3. Ensure that all JavaScript files are linked correctly in the HTML file.
4. Interact with the elements on the page to see the JavaScript functionality in action.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Select HTML elements in JavaScript.
- Understand the differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- Modify HTML element styles and content.
- Manipulate the DOM effectively.
- Make network requests using `XmlHTTPRequest` and the Fetch API.
- Handle user events and bind event listeners.
